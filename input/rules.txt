Creating a strong resume is all about clarity, relevance, and impact. 
Here are **core rules** to follow when generating a resume — whether you're building one from scratch or refining an existing version:

---

### 📄 **1. Structure & Formatting**
- **Keep it 1–2 pages** max (unless you're very senior).
- **Use clear sections:** Contact Info, Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects (optional).
- Use **reverse chronological order** (most recent first).
- Keep **fonts clean** (e.g., Calibri, Arial, Helvetica) and sizes between 10–12 pt.
- **Avoid graphics or fancy design** unless you're in a creative field (use ATS-friendly layout).

---

### 🧠 **2. Tailored Summary**
- A 2–3 sentence **career summary** at the top is helpful.
- Tailor it to the role you're applying for. Mention your title, experience, and what you bring to the table.

> _Example:_
> _"Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of experience in LLMs, MLOps, and cloud deployment. Proven track record in building scalable AI solutions and leading production-grade ML pipelines."_

---

### 💼 **3. Experience (Most Important)**
- Each role should include:  
  `Job Title – Company | Location | Dates (Month YYYY – Month YYYY)`
- Use **bullet points** (3–6 per job).
- Start each bullet with a **strong action verb** (Built, Led, Automated, Deployed, etc.).
- Focus on **achievements and impact**, not just responsibilities.
- **Quantify when possible**: 
  - “Reduced model latency by 30%”
  - “Improved accuracy from 85% to 92%”

---

### 🧰 **4. Skills Section**
- Highlight **technical and soft skills** relevant to the role.
- Be honest — list only skills you’d be comfortable discussing in an interview.
- Optionally split into:  
  `Programming`, `ML Frameworks`, `Cloud`, `DevOps`, `Soft Skills`, etc.

---

### 🎓 **5. Education**
- Include degree, institution, graduation date.
- Mention certifications (Coursera, edX, AWS, etc.) if they’re recent or relevant.

---

### 🛠️ **6. Projects (Optional but Great)**
- Highlight 1–3 key projects (especially if you're early career).
- Focus on the problem, your approach, tools used, and results.
- Link to GitHub or portfolio if applicable.

---

### 🚫 **7. Avoid These Mistakes**
- ❌ Spelling/grammar errors.
- ❌ Too much jargon or fluff.
- ❌ Listing every job or tech you’ve ever touched.
- ❌ Passive voice ("Was responsible for...").
- ❌ Using "References available on request" — it's outdated.

---

### ✅ **Bonus Tips**
- Use **keywords from the job description** (for ATS parsing).
- Save as **PDF** unless instructed otherwise.
- Use tools like **Rezi, Teal, or Resume Worded** for feedback.
- Keep an updated **LinkedIn profile** to match your resume.
